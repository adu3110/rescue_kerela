# rescue_kerela
used some of my coding knowledge to help rescuers find location of the people affected in Kerela Flood 2018.

So coded a location finder, for flood victims to recue them,by using message data and segemented the data on the basis of criticality (pregnant, kid, injured etc)
repeated messages, correct location (messages outside kerela)
